  <!-- # Breakdown:

# git branch: This is the main command to work with branches in Git.
# -M: This option is specifically used to move the HEAD pointer to the new branch name.
# main: This is the new name you're giving to the current branch.

# In simpler terms:
# Imagine your current branch is named "master."

# git branch -M main will:
#   - Rename the "master" branch to "main."
#   - Update the HEAD pointer to now point to the "main" branch. -->


<!-- Purpose:

This command is used to push your local changes from the main branch to the remote repository named origin. Additionally, it sets up a tracking relationship between your local main branch and the remote origin/main branch.

Breakdown:

git push: This is the main command for uploading local commits to a remote repository.
-u: This option sets up a tracking relationship between your local main branch and the remote origin/main branch. This means that subsequent git push commands can be simplified to just git push without specifying the branch names.
origin: This is the name of the remote repository you're pushing to. It's a common default name, but you can have other remote names as well.
main: This is the name of the local branch you're pushing.
In Simpler Terms:

Imagine you're working on a project with a team. Your local changes are on the main branch, and you want to share them with the rest of the team. The remote repository origin is where everyone's work is stored.

git push -u origin main does two things:
It sends your local main branch's changes to the remote origin repository.
It tells Git that main is linked to origin/main, so you don't have to specify both names every time you push. -->
